          <h4>Zoro vs King Edit(2024/01/04)</h4>
          <p>This is one of my favourite edits that I made, even though I understand that it is a basic edit.
            <br>
            I still like the final outcome of this one.
            <br>
            Took quiet a while to get it done and the outcome was really satisfying to me ofcourse.
            <br>
            I know this one has the episodes audio but I think thats what makes this one even better.

          <p>This is one of my first "best" edits at the time and I really liked the idea behind it. 
            <br>
            It was more a less a mini story in my head at-least.
            <br>
            Even though the execution of this one was poor, it is still a really good edit , if you ignore the rough edges.
            <br>
            If you listen closely to the audio you can hear the clip audio, I guess previous me forgot to mute the clip audio lol :)
            <br>
            But its warranted because it shows that I was a complete beginner just messing around with the episode.

          <p>This one I have done later in my editing "journey", trying to fix the older one to make it "better". 
            <br>
            The differences are evident if your are a stickler for perfection or whatever, but I tried.
            <br>
            Even though this didn't really make it better , it's almost a good edit.
            <br>
            The issues with this one is that IT HAS TOO MUCH STUFF ON IT i.e. effects, transitions etc.

          <p>OH God, don't get me started on this one.
            <br>
            What a mess of an edit, GOLLLY, this one is a hard watch I'm not gonna lie.
            <br>
            Its just so BADDD.
            <br>
            I planned to make another one last year (2024), but I got lazy and never got back to it and just continued to make newer edits.
            <br>
            But DO plan to make a new Sanji edit this year(2025).(promise)

            I think I made this before or after the Sanji edit, idk, but its good.

            <br>
            I think I got burnt out after. Took a while to get back.

          <p>This one was I think my second or third edit EVER!!, Crazy Right.
            <br>
            I made this one in a pirated Premier pro lol, as well as my first edit which was a Levi Ackerman one,
            only problem with that one was I didn't know I had to export the videos when done so ,when Premier pro was deleted , I lost that too.
            <br>
            I could technically call this my first edit but I don't.
            <br>
            This one makes me giggle cuz I used Erai-raw anime clips, which are clips that are cut and more or less edited for you,
             but I'm proud how good this one turned out.

            <br>
            But it could be better. Every time I watch it I just see things I want to fix to make it better.
            <br>

          <p>AHHH, this one I loved no cap, I was very proud of it until I rewatched it for the third time, then the problems began.
            <br>
            Every time I rewatched it after that it hurt me alot, would have been great if it wasn't done in an amateurish way.

          <h4>HTTYD(V1)[2024/12/23]</h4>
          <p>Had the movie on my USB for a while, decided why not make an edit after all this time.
            <br>
            Very satisfied with the outcome after like a month or 2 of not editing.

        <p>I had recently found this song after watching District 13 lol, great movie früëç. When I listened to this song for a second time I thought a lot of Marineford Arc so thats why I really made this edit. 
          I feel like its still lacking but its a really good edit if I do say so myself.üò§
